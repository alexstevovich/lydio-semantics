**Structured, Meaningful HTML Composition**

**`@lydio/semantics`** provides a structured approach to HTML generation, emphasizing **semantic correctness** and **hierarchical meaning extraction**. It extends Lydioâ€™s core capabilities by introducing specialized **semantic node classes** that mirror real-world document structure.

**Github:**
[https://github.com/alexstevovich/lydio-semantics](https://github.com/alexstevovich/lydio-semantics)

**Lydio (Core):**
[https://github.com/alexstevovich/lydio](https://github.com/alexstevovich/lydio)

## **Features:**

- **Semantic Elements** â€“ Direct representations of `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and more.
- **Extract Meaning** â€“ Convert Lydio structures into meaningful JSON representations.
- **Accessible Defaults** â€“ Encourages `aria-label` and `alt` attributes where relevant.
- **Audit** - Automatically audits semantic components for correctness.

## Installation

```bash
npm install lydio
npm install @lydio/semantics
```

**Note** lydio is required but not listed as a dependency to simplify installation on private package managers. Please ensure both are installed!

## Usage

```js
import semantics from '@lydio/semantics';

const mySite = new Site('example.com', 'Example Site');
const homepage = new Page('/', { lang: 'en-US', description: 'A demo page' });
homepage.html.head.append(new Nav());
homepage.html.body
    .append(new Main())
    .append(new Article())
    .p('Welcome to our site!');
mySite.append(homepage);

mySite.audit();
console.log(mySite.toHtml());
console.log(mySite.toMeaning());
```

## **Semantic Elements Overview**

### **Page Composition**

- **`Site(domain, name)`** â†’ Represents a website structure.
- **`Page(route, options)`** â†’ A structured page with metadata.
- **`Html(lang)`** â†’ The root `<html>` element with language attributes.
- **`Head()`** â†’ The `<head>` section.
- **`Body()`** â†’ The `<body>` section.

### **Document Structure Elements**

- **`Main()`** â†’ `<main>` wrapper.
- **`Article()`** â†’ `<article>` content block.
- **`Section()`** â†’ `<section>` element.
- **`Nav()`** â†’ `<nav>` for navigation menus.
- **`Header()` / `Footer()`** â†’ `<header>` and `<footer>`.

### **Content Elements**

- **`H1` - `H6`** â†’ Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`).
- **`P()`** â†’ Paragraph (`<p>`).
- **`UL()` / `OL()`** â†’ Unordered and ordered lists.
- **`A().href(value)`** â†’ `<a>` link with an optional `aria-label`.
- **`IMG().src(value).alt(value)`** â†’ `<img>` with required `alt`.
- **`Button().ariaLabel(value)`** â†’ `<button>` element with `aria-label`.

## Auditing and Meaning Extraction

Lydio Semantics extends Lydioâ€™s core auditing and meaning extraction capabilities, providing **richer analysis** and **more structured insights** into semantic correctness.

### Audit

Every semantic node can be audited to provide feedback on **best practices**, **accessibility compliance**, and **SEO optimizations**.

### Semantic Meaning

Every semantic node can be converted into **a structured JSON representation** using `toMeaning()`. This ensures that content retains its logical intent when processed, analyzed, or repurposed.

```js
const section = new Section();
section.append(new H1().text('Our Services'));
section.append(new P().text('We offer high-quality software solutions.'));
console.log(section.toMeaning());
```

**Output**

```json
{
    "type": "section",
    "content": [
        { "type": "h", "depth": 1, "content": "Our Services" },
        { "type": "p", "content": "We offer high-quality software solutions." }
    ]
}
```

### See Everything At Once

Unlike raw HTML, which can obscure important attributes or dynamically hidden text, **structured meaning extraction** allows you to **see all relevant content at once**. This includes:

- **ARIA labels, alt text, and metadata** that might not be visible in a normal rendered page.
- **Nested content relationships**, showing how different elements fit together.
- **Full textual content**, making proofreading and editing easier.

This is particularly useful for:

- **SEO analysis**
- **Accessibility verification**
- **Large-scale content audits**
- **Machine-readable site overviews**

### Futurism

By pairing layout and meaning as structured data, `@lydio/semantics` enables **new possibilities** for web rendering and accessibility:

- **Adaptive Browsing** â€“ Users could define how they want content presented, separating structure from display.
- **Intelligent Content Processing** â€“ Meaningful data extraction makes websites more interpretable by AI and assistive technologies.
- **Editable JSON-Based Site Representation** â€“ Websites could be edited as structured meaning rather than raw HTML.
